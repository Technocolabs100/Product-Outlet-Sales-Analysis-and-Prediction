Mini-Project
BigMart Data Analysis - Build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store:

## Problem Statement:
The task is to build a predictive model that can estimate the sales of each product at a particular store for BigMart. The data comprises sales information of 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities,along with various attributes for each product and store.

### Project Goals:
Build a predictive model capable of estimating product sales at specific stores. Understand the key attributes of both products and stores that significantly influence sales. Provide insights to help BigMart strategize and enhance sales performance.Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

### Challenges:
Though the dataset contains missing values it is required appropriate handling to ensure accurate model training. Identifying the most influential features is crucial for model interpretability as the Products and stores have diverse attributes .

## Hypothesis Generation
Hypotheses are initial assumptions or educated guesses about the factors that might influence the target variable, in this case, the sales of products in BigMart. These hypotheses guide the analysis and help formulate strategies for further investigation.

Store Location : Stores located in Tier 1 cities might experience higher sales compared to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities due to increased population and purchasing power.

Store Size and Sales : Stores which are very big in size may witness higher sales, as they could accommodate a wider variety of products and attract more customers as they act like one-stop-shops and people would prefer getting everything from one place.

Product Visibility : The location of product in a store will impact sales. Products with higher visibility within stores could lead to increased sales.

Effect of Establishment Year : Stores that have been established for a longer duration may have higher sales due to increased brand recognition and customer trust.

Product Type : Products which are given bigger shelves in the store are likely to catch attention first and sell more,Certain product categories, such as "Fruits and Vegetables" or "Snack Foods," might contribute significantly to overall sales due to their daily consumption nature.

Pricing : Products with higher Maximum Retail Price (MRP) might experience lower sales unless they are offered discounts or promotions.

Competitors : Stores having similar establishments nearby should have less sales because of more competition.

Marketing : Stores which have a good marketing division should have higher sales as it will be able to attract customers through the right offers and advertising.

Location : Stores located within popular marketplaces should have higher sales because of better access to customers.

Ambiance : Stores which are well-maintained and managed by polite and humble people are expected to have higher footfall and thus higher sales.
